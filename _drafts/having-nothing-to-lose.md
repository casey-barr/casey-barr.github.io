# A short excerpt I read from [Delaneyplace](https://delanceyplace.com/view-archives.php?p=3970) that deserves more attention from just my reading log.

>"Nerve most commonly comes from having nothing to lose. ... That means you're either so low it looks like up to you, so rich you can sustain a loss, or **believe in something so strongly you don't care what anyone thinks.**"

>"One of the most winning power strategies is the ability to walk away from a deal. People want you when you don't need them and it stuns them that you're willing to splitâ€”it implies that you are fine without them. Then they wonder how they will be fine without you."

>"**The tragedy is that talent with no nerve equals failure, whereas there are many careers that attest the power of nerve alone.**"
