## About Me

I am currently located in Miami, FL. I graduated from the Florida State University in 2016, with a double major in Economics and Political Science Modeling, and a concentration in Mathematics.  
 
I'm currently focused on cryptocurrency, decentralized finance, and machine learning. This website will be a self-documentation of my learning journey. You can contact me through email (see the link to the left) or check out any of the other links for my online presence.
