> Nightfall is autonomous twitter bot that daily generates webcomic from a model trained on my favorite Isaac Asimov stories. The background images are generated from [OPUS (Outer Planets Unified Search)](https://tools.pds-rings.seti.org/opus/#) which contians more than 1,500,000 images and spectra of the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and the Kuiper Belt) from Voyagers 1 and 2, Galileo, Cassini, New Horizons, and the Hubble Space Telescope. Here's a link to the [nightfall twitter page](https://twitter.com/nightfall_bot).
