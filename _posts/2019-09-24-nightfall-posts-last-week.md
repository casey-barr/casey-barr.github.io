This post is simply a collection of some of my favorite webcomics that my synthetic intelligence, [nightfall](https://nightfall.glitch.me), 
created during the last week and a half from September 15-24, 2019. 

The week prior I re-trained nightfall's model on some more of Isaac Asimov's stories, and that greatly increased the diversity 
of content and made its sentence structure a lot better. I really like this little bot!
